### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
-Global Value Chain Participation and Carbon Embodied in Exports: An Experiment from Forest Trade Shock 
                                                                       Jun 2022 – Dec 2022
-<b>Member Advisor:</b> Dr. Guo Ling
-Research Content: This study explores the relationship between global value chain (GVC) participation and carbon emissions in forest product exports from 41 countries (2002-2014). Findings show that during the 2008 financial crisis, countries with larger GVC changes reduced more embodied carbon via decreasing export scale and capital investment. <p>It also found that a decrease in skilled personnel growth can increase carbon emissions. Therefore, enhancing GVC technology with skilled forestry personnel could reduce the carbon footprint in exports. </p>
-Responsibilities:
Analysed forest product global value chain impacts on carbon emissions using economic models and statistical software
Assembled and curated datasets for empirical modelling
Executed Two-Stage Least Squares regression, parallel trend tests, placebo tests, and robustness tests using Stata
Achievements: Awarded third prize for 2022 excellent paper from China Society of Forestry Economics
